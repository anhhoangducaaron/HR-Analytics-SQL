HR Management System (PostgreSQL Project)

📌 Introduction
This project is a SQL-driven HR Management System in which I designed a relational database and implemented a variety of queries to manage employee information, payroll, attendance, and related HR operations.

I built this project after learning PostgreSQL through Datacamp course, and I’m grateful for the practical knowledge gained from it. The project was created as a hands-on exercise to reinforce my learning and successfully complete the course.

All database structures and SQL queries were independently designed and written by me using the concepts covered in the course. To efficiently populate tables that required large datasets, I used Python with libraries such as pandas, faker, and csv to generate realistic sample data.

📂 About the Database
This project represents a simulated Human Resource (HR) Management System that enables an organization to manage employee-related processes effectively. The database is composed of several interconnected tables that cover key HR functions, including employees, job roles, departments, attendance, and payroll.

🛠️ Database Tables

Employees – Contains employee information such as names, job IDs, departments, and salaries

Jobs – Defines job positions along with their salary ranges

Departments – Organizes the company’s departmental structure

Attendance – Records monthly employee attendance data

Payroll – Manages employee salary payments

📸 SQL Query Showcase
To demonstrate my SQL proficiency, the project includes 30 sample queries along with screenshots of their execution and results. These examples highlight a range of SQL concepts, including:

✔️ Basic SELECT queries
✔️ Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
✔️ Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
✔️ GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
✔️ Subqueries
✔️ CASE expressions
✔️ Data manipulation operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
